# Recognition of Face Emotion in Real-Time using OpenCV 
<br>
**Overview:** <br>
This project implements a real-time facial emotion recognition system using OpenCV for face detection and the DeepFace library for emotion analysis. The application captures live video from a webcam, detects faces, and classifies their emotions.
<br><br>
Features:<br>
Real-time face detection using Haar cascades.
Emotion analysis using the DeepFace library with pre-trained models.
Annotates detected faces with their dominant emotion in the video feed.
Simple and intuitive implementation with minimal dependencies.
